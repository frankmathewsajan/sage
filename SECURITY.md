- Do not open public issues for security reports.
- We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and provide a status update or fix plan within 14 days.

## Scope

- Hosted deployments of Sage managed by the core team.

## Guidelines for reporters

- Avoid data destruction; use test accounts where possible.
- Coordinated disclosure is appreciated; we will credit researchers on request once a fix is released.
